# VinylMap
Vinyl Map was created so that vinyl collecting can be more local and social. 
Users can add to their collection through scanning barcodes, or through manual search.
After adding to their collection, users can choose to sell or trade the albums at a convenient location.
Maps show all available albums near user, and allows user chat for easy meetups.
